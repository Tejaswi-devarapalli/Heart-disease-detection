**Problem Statement** <br />
One of the major factors in human mortality is heart disease. The WHO estimates that heart disease causes 17.9 million deaths worldwide each year. In this project,I explored machine learning methods such as Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine, Fully-Connected Neural Networks to detect heart disease using tabular data, including both categorical and numeric features. Machine Learning can play an essential role in predicting presence or absence of heart diseases. In the diagnosis of heart disease, machine learning approaches help to improve data- driven decision-making.

<br />
The dataset used for the models combines 5 popular heart disease datasets over 11 common features. This dataset consists of 1190 instances with 11 features. To preprocess the data,I checked and dropped the rows with missing values, duplicates. I have also done one hot encoding and normalization for our data.
